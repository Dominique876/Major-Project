# Major-Project
<h1>The development of an  Academic Advice Expert System for students placed on or probable to be placed on academic probation at the School of Computing and Information Technology (SCIT)<h1>
<p>The system was created because we wanted to see why students were on or probable to be on academic probation, what where the factors that caused students to fall in this category. We developed two quiz based on a questionnare we distributed,with these quiz we determine the type of learner a student is (auditory, visual or kinesthetic). The diagonostic test is made of twenty two(22) question which we used to determine what is likely to be the reason for a student to be or nearing probation.<p>
We also made it easier for students to know who there academic advisors are, along with the advisors details for contact. 
A feature that was added is a chatbot to schedule meeting with advisor or student.
